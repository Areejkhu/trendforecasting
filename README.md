📊 Fashion Demand Forecasting for Clothing Brands
🔍 Business Problem

Fashion brands often rely on intuition or past-season performance when planning production. This leads to overproduction, excess inventory, and capital lock-in, especially in fast-moving fashion cycles.

Core Question:

Which clothing categories should a fashion brand increase, maintain, or reduce production for in the upcoming season?
🎯 Project Objective

This project demonstrates how historical retail sales data can be transformed into actionable production and inventory decisions for fashion brands.

The goal is not just forecasting — but turning data into clear business recommendations.

📈 Key Insights
Category-Level Trends

Tops and Bottoms show consistent demand and stable revenue contribution

Outerwear exhibits higher volatility and seasonality

Accessories provide smaller but relatively stable revenue streams

Demand Forecast – Tops Category

Short-term forecasting indicates stable demand over the next three months

No evidence suggests a need for aggressive production scaling
💡 Business Recommendations

Maintain current production levels for Tops to avoid unnecessary overstock

Use flexible inventory planning rather than long production runs

Treat stable categories as revenue anchors

Allocate experimental or limited-run production to more trend-sensitive categories
🏭 Why This Matters for Fashion Brands
